# Project_Diabetes_Prediction

The notebook Tao_040926874.ipynb contains a project on diabetes prediction using machine learning algorithms.
This homework used the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset to train and test the algorithms.

The notebook starts with a brief introduction to the dataset and data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, feature scaling, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Next, the excercises have been completed: displot, boxplot, scatterplot 

Then, implemented various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and compared their performance metrics, such as accuracy.

This project visualized the results compare the two ML models: Logistic Regression model and Random forest model.

Finally,  concluded that the random forest algorithm performs the best among all the algorithms with an accuracy of 79.55%.
