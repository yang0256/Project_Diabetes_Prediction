# Project_Diabetes_Prediction

The notebook Tao_040926874.ipynb contains a project on diabetes prediction using machine learning algorithms.
This homework used the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset to train and test the algorithms.

The notebook file starts with a brief introduction to the dataset - diabetes.csv, and data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, feature scaling, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Different plots have been studied, including displot for distribution plotting, pairplot, boxplot, scatterplot for visulization, and heatmap plot used for correlation.

Then, this project implemented various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, confusion matrix, random forest, and compared their performance metrics, such as accuracy.

This project printed out the results in comparing the two ML models: Logistic Regression model and Random forest model.

Finally,  concluded that the random forest algorithm performs the best among all the algorithms with an accuracy of 79.55%.
